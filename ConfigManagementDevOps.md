**Configuration Management and DevOps: Automate Infrastructure Deployments**

**Duration**  
2 days

**Modality**  
Virtual / ILT

**Platform**  
Linux and Mac OS

**Level**  
Introduction/Intermediate

---

**Overview**  
DevOps cannot be implemented by only adding new tools. DevOps cultural changes enable communication between Development, Operations, and Quality Assurance teams. The DevOps principles lead to faster development of applications requiring frequent deployments, and it is impossible to keep up without automating your infrastructure through configuration management.

---

**Audience**  
The audience for this class includes Team Leads, DevOps Architects, and any other Engineering personnel interested in an introduction to DevOps. This class teaches DevOps cultural changes and practices, configuration management tools, best practices, and automation of infrastructure creation and management using Ansible, Terraform, and other proven tools.

**Student Backgrounds:**
- Varied skill sets. Some are heavily using Ansible today. Some don’t have any experience with Ansible.
- Smaller teams have expertise with **DevSecOps** and **Policy-as-Code**.
- They're using **GitHub Enterprise** and transitioning from **BitBucket/Bamboo**.
- Have some experience with CI/CD and version control concepts.
- 50% are using GitHub for version control.
- Using **Open Policy Agent** to define policies applied in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Small team working with Terraform, but with only basic training.
- Using VMs, PCFs, and Containers/Kubernetes.
- Stress on concepts of configuration drift—Ansible can help resolve.

**Solutions**  
Attendees will leave with an understanding of DevOps and how implementing the culture and tools will improve communication between teams. They will learn how to use **Infrastructure as Code** principles with Ansible, Terraform, Packer, and other tools. This class also teaches best practices for storing configuration data in version control, writing tests to confirm infrastructure was deployed correctly, and utilizing community modules.
